# CPX_Setup

A script to automate the setup of CPXs

Place all files on the Cloud Connector VM

Make the setup-setup.sh file executable and then run it (this makes the other script files executable and moves them to their correct locations)

The main script is then triggered at login/profile load (but only when 'setup_stage: ' does not have a value of 'complete' in the 'setup_config' file)
